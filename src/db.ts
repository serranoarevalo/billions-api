    bio: "Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth, through electric car maker Tesla -- and in space, via rocket producer SpaceX. He owns about 25% of Tesla between stock and options, but has pledged more than half his stock as collateral for loans; Forbes has applied a discount to take the loans into account. Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion on April 25, 2022, after he disclosed a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover. SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is valued at $100 billion after a funding round in December 2021. He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He landed in the U.S. as a transfer student to the University of Pennsylvania.",

      "Musk was accepted to a graduate program at Stanford, but deferred attendance to launch his first business, software company Zip2. As a kid Musk taught himself to code; he sold his first game, Blastar, for about $500. ",

Bankman-Fried launched his own exchange, FTX, in 2019. Built "by traders, for traders," it\'s one of the leading exchanges for buying and selling crypto derivatives. Investors valued FTX at $18 billion in 2021, helping make him one of the richest people under 30 in history. The exchange and its U.S. operations hit a combined $40 billion valuation in January 2022. Most of his wealth, which he says he will eventually donate to charity based on a philosophy called "earning to give," is tied up in ownership of about half of FTX and a share of its FTT tokens.',

    bio: "China restaurateur Zhang Yong is chairman of Sichuan hotpot chain Haidilao, which went public in September 2018.  Haidilao now has $3.8 billion in sales from 1,300 restaurants, mostly in China but also in the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Singapore.  Haidilao is renowned for its spicy dishes and attentive customer service, including offering free manicures for waiting customers. Having never finished high school, the entrepreneur says he didn't even know how to prepare the typical Sichuan hotpot when he started. Three friends, including one who became his wife, helped with seed money, but he ran the place. In March 2022, he stepped down as CEO to focus on long-term strategies.",

    bio: "N.R. Narayana Murthy is the legendary cofounder and retired chairman of Indian tech giant Infosys, in which he continues to hold a minority stake. Murthy stepped down as chairman in 2011 after 30 years with the company but returned in 2013 to hand over management to a professional CEO in 2014. In 2017, Murthy was in the news for raising concerns over alleged corporate governance lapses at Infosys, which the company denied. The controversy led to the CEO's resignation and a board shakeup, which saw the return of retired cofounder Nandan Nilekani as nonexecutive chairman.  In August 2021, his private investment firm Catamaran Ventures agreed to sell its stake in a joint venture with Amazon India.",

    bio: "N. Murray Edwards derives much of his fortune from stakes in Canadian oil and mining companies. His largest investments include oil sands miner Canadian Natural Resources, aerospace firm Magellan and a minority stake in the NHL's Calgary Flames. A lawyer by training, Edwards made the jump to business at age 28 after promising a dying friend that he would always pursue his passions. He started a merchant bank with partners in the late 1980's, but they spent half their initial capital on digging a natural gas well that came up dry. Edwards then switched gears and diversified from exploration to investing in existing oil and gas assets.",

    bio: "S. Daniel Abraham founded Slim-Fast in 1976. Sales exploded in the late 1980s when former LA Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda became its spokesman. Abraham sold the weight loss and meal substitute company to Unilever for $2.3 billion in cash in 2000.  Since then, he's largely taken a risk-averse approach to investing, keeping most of his fortune in cash and liquid assets. In 2014, Unilever sold the majority of Slim-Fast to Texas private equity firm Kainos Capital for an undisclosed sum.   Abraham donated $3 million to Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential run. ",

Hardy turned over the company to Knox, one of his four kids, in 1992 when she was just 26 years old. The company topped $1 billion in sales in 1993. 84 Lumber took a hit during the 2009 recession and Knox closed half of its 500 stores. Today the company operates nearly 250 stores in 30 states. She also owns a resort in rural Pennsylvania, which was modeled after the Ritz in Paris and holds vintage airplanes and a piece of the Berlin Wall. ",

Founded in 1979 by her father, Giorgio, Copan initially distributed lab products and started to make swabs in 1982, when her brother Daniele joined the firm. Daniele succeeded Giorgio after his death in 2002; in 2003, he invented flocked swabs, which collect more sample material than regular cotton Q-tips. Stefania took over as CEO after Daniele's death in 2014; the Covid-19 pandemic led to a dramatic surge in demand for Copan's products. Flocked swabs made up more than 80% of Copan's $445 million revenues in 2021; the firm also makes machines and software that automate diagnostics.",

He quickly upgraded his packaging, equipment and distributor network, then struck gold with Yuengling Lager, today responsible for about 85% of sales.
